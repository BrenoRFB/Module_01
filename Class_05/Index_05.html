	<h2> Testing style 0</h2>
	<h3> Testing style 1 </h3>
	<h4> Testing style 2 </h4>
	<p><a style="text-decoration: none; color: blue" target="_blank" href="http://localhost/front%20end%20project/Module_01/Class_04/index_04.html">This link</a> is going to work only in PCs which have the localhost set up with the previous files, and will open in a new tab `cause I added the `target=_blank` attribute.</p>

	<p>Another way to declare the style is into the document. Check "<*head> to see how it works."</p>
