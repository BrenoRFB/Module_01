	<h1> Setting images </h1>
	<p>To set up an image you must link it to your file, to do so you use `img` tag with the value `src` and <br/>add the link to the image. </p>
	<p>To modify the picture size use `weight` and `height` tags with their respectives values. </p>
	<img src="../../../images/patience.gif" width="30%" height="40%" />
	<p> OMG, after so many trials i finally got it. The path for the image was wrong.</p>
